# HR-Attrition-Churn-Analysis-and-Prediction

# Project Overview

Employee attrition (churn) is one of the biggest challenges for HR teams.
This project combines SQL, Power BI, and Machine Learning (SVC) to provide a 360° analysis and prediction of employee attrition.

 # Workflow:

SQL → Data analysis and insights
Power BI → Interactive dashboard for visualization
Python (svc) → Predictive modeling

# Dataset

The dataset contains HR employee records with:

Demographics: Age, Gender, Marital Status, Education

Job Details: Department, Job Role, Job Level, Years at Company, Overtime

Compensation: Monthly Income, Daily Rate, Stock Options

Performance & Satisfaction: Performance Rating, Job Satisfaction, Environment Satisfaction

Target Variable: Attrition (Yes/No)

#  Tech Stack

SQL → MySQL(for churn analysis)

Power BI → Dashboard & data visualization

Python → pandas, numpy, seaborn, matplotlib, scikit-learn (SVC)


# Key Findings (SQL):

Most churn occurs among employees aged  18–35

Employees working overtime show higher attrition
Employees Who are Singles show higher attrition
Employees with Low Job Statisfaction shows higher Attrition
Employees with Average Distance from home shows higher attrition
Certain departments like  shows highest churn Sales and Human Resource Department
Satisfaction levels & income strongly influence attrition

# Power BI Dashboard
The dashboard shows:
Attrition by Age, Gender, Department
Overtime vs Attrition
Salary distribution by Attrition
Job Satisfaction vs Attrition

#  Machine Learning 
Models  Used : SVC  ,Logistic Regreesion
Features: Age, Overtime, Monthly Income, Work-Life Balance, Job Involvement, Years at Company, etc.
Target: Attrition (Yes/No)
Accuracy:71%

 # Key Business Insights

Young employees (18–35) are most likely to leave
Overtime workers churn at a much higher rate
Employees with low satisfaction and low salary are more prone to churn

# Future Enhancements

Test other ML models (Random Forest, XGBoost, Neural Networks)
